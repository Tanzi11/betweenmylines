## between my lines
A Q & A app that was inspired from an exhibition I co-produced in Canada. It's still in its early phases, but the idea is that the community of creatores narrates their own stories in any medium (e.g., video, photo, etc.) and asks questions of each other's work.

# Motivation
The exhibition was a community-building experiment and demo for my final project at the DO School in Berlin, a social incubator. I wanted a space, especially as hate crime and xenophobia was rising, where communities could represent themselves and take control of their own narratives.
# Usage
